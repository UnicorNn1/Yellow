# Yellow Network
Powered by state channel technology to enable real-time cross-chain trading without the need for brokers to bridge assets.
Yellow Network solves the problem of genuinely decentralized trading by allowing participants to swap assets across different exchanges without having to rely on block creation. This brings all parties, exchanges, blockchains, and trading firms together, creating a network of brokerages and allowing for a more efficient trading infrastructure.
